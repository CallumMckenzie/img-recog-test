The design of the program currently is to take a collection of whale tail images 
and match them with previously taken images

The program will do this through the following process
1. Extracting the images from a PDF into a collection of folders of different example folders (future feature)
2. Automatic background removal from the image (in progress)
3. feature removal (optional)
4. Training a convd model/dense model (depending on feature extraction) for image classification
5. Using the trained model to match new photos to existing ones

Upcoming features:
1. GUI that combines all the steps above
2. a parrallel process for setting a pointer and extracting masks (for background cropping)
3. A functional conv2D model
4. A pre-prepared running environment

Objectives:
1. Automate the whale identification process as much as possible
2. make the identification of whales as accurate as possible
3. Make the program extremely easy to use even for non-technical users


Programs and how they function:

    Cropper:
    The cropper program, takes an image and a pointer location then uses grounded-SAM () to generate
    3 masks over the selected area (to try and place a mask over the tail)

    The user then chooses between the 3 images or adjusts the pointer (to generate another 3 masks)

    After the mask has been confirmed the program then removes the background and saves the image to a new database folder system to be used in the next program

Cropper notes:
    * Cropper needs to get pointers first and parrallel process all the images,
    * It then needs to display all the masks side-by-side in a simplified user interface allowing the user
        to easily select the mask they want saved to the database
    * pointer information should be aquired by the user clicking on the whale tail
    * need to allow the user to manually determine the location of the images to be processed
        the output location should always remain the same though


\WF-42\WF-42 2018 (2).png needs to be recropped

in the AI execution program, put the image side-by-side with an image of the ai's best guess for manual
validation

Once validation has occured, move the image into the database for upload
